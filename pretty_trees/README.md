### Welcome to Chapter 6: Beautifying Streamlit Apps

This folder contains the initial plotting app as our first example of how to run a Streamlit app, and uses some of the libraries held in the requirements.txt file within the [central folder](https://github.com/tylerjrichards/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science/blob/main/requirements.txt). Download these libraries using [pip](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/) before getting started here!  
If you think there is a problem with this code, please [open an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or just find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and DM me!
