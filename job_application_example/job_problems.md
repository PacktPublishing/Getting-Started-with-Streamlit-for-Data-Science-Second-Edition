## Question 1: Airport Distance

The first exercise asks us 'Given the included dataset of airports and locations (in latitude and longitude), write a function that takes an airport code as input and returns the airports listed from nearest to furthest from the input airport.


## Question 2 - Representation

Note: Don’t worry about writing code in this section, you can just describe any transformations of the data you would perform. Your description should be clear enough that a data scientist reading this would know how to implement your solution if necessary. Here is an example of a single user’s searches in our app:

How would you transform this collection of searches into a numeric vector representing a trip? Assume that we have hundreds of thousands of users and we want to represent all of their trips this way. We ideally want this to be a general representation we could use in multiple different modeling projects, but we definitely care about finding similar trips.
How, precisely, would you compare two trips to see how similar they are?
What information do you feel might be missing from data above that would be helpful in improving your representation?
