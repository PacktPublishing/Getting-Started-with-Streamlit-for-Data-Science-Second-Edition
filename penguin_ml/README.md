### Welcome to Chapter 4: Using Machine Learning with Streamlit

This folder contains the machine learning app created to predict the species of penguin from Palmer's Penguins, and uses some of the libraries held in the requirements.txt file within the [central folder](https://github.com/tylerjrichards/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science/blob/main/requirements.txt). Download these libraries using [pip](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/) before getting started here!  
In this chapter, there is a section where we learn about Streamlit secrets and how to edit them in your Streamlit Sharing applications. If you are running this code locally, you will get an error saying that there is no file called secrets.toml in your project repository! To run this locally, go ahead and create this file and place your secrets there. 
If you think there is a problem with this code, please [open an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or just find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and DM me!
